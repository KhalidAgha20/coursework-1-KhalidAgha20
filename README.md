# Coursework 2

## Introduction
In coursework 1, a plan was set up for building a datascience software for a client. The purpose of the software is to
act as a tool to visualize statistics about tennis match times. This software would bve used by tournament organizers
and broadcasters to allocate times for matches. The software has been named Tennis Statistics (TS) tool.

## Requirements definition and analysis
Requirements of a software development process point out features that must be present in the completed version of the
software. These requirements can be functional meaning that they specify a specific feature or action to be added to
the system. Another type of requirements is nom-functional requirements which specify features regarding the performance
and usability of the software. This part focuses on the methods used to elicit and prioritise these requirements.

### Requirements identification methods
To identify the requirements, the methods listed on Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK). BABOK recommends a list
of techniques used to elicit the requirements of a software engineering project. The listed techniques are:

- Interviews
- Workshops
- Surveys
- Interface Analysis
- Focus Groups
- Observation
- Brainstorming
- Prototyping
- Analysing Documentation

Due to the time constraint of this project, not all the listed techniques can be utilised. The ones that can fit into
the timeframe of the project are **interviews**, **surveys**, **brainstorming**, and **documentation analysis**. Thus,
these will be the methods used for elicitation of requirements.

Two of the selected methods, interviews and surveys, require to be done with appropriate people to achieve the best
results. To identify these people of interest, a context diagram is provide a vague idea of the use of the software.

### Requirement specification method

### Prioritisation method

### Documented and prioritised requirements
Link to the full list of documented and prioritised requirements.


## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface

### Relational database design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.
