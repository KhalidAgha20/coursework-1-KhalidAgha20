# Coursework 2

## Introduction
In coursework 1, a plan was set up for building a datascience software for a client. The purpose of the software is to
act as a tool to visualize statistics about tennis match times. This software would bve used by tournament organizers
and broadcasters to allocate times for matches. The software has been named Tennis Statistics (TS) tool.

## Requirements definition and analysis
User Stories of a software development process point out features that must be present in the completed version of the
software. These requirements can be functional meaning that they specify a specific feature or action to be added to
the system. Another type of requirements is non-functional requirements which specify features regarding the performance
and usability of the software. This part focuses on the methods used to elicit and prioritise these requirements.

### Identification methods
To identify the requirements, the methods listed on Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK). BABOK recommends a list
of techniques used to elicit the requirements of a software engineering project. The listed techniques are:

- Interviews
- Workshops
- Surveys
- Interface Analysis
- Focus Groups
- Observation
- Brainstorming
- Prototyping
- Analysing Documentation

Due to the time constraint of this project, not all the listed techniques can be utilised. The ones that can fit into
the timeframe of the project are **interviews**, **surveys**, **brainstorming**, and **documentation analysis**. Thus,
these will be the methods used for elicitation of requirements.

Two of the selected methods, interviews and surveys, require to be done with appropriate people to achieve the best
results. To identify these people of interest, a context diagram is provide a vague idea of the use of the software.

Based on the figure shown above interviews need to be held with potential corporate users and advertisers. Furthermore,
surveys are a good method of data collection from the general user base. Another point that needs to be taken into
consideration is the fact that the team is working using an agile variant of CRISP-DM methodology. Thus, regular 
meetings with the clients is another method used to set project requirements.

### Specification method
As the methodology being used is an agile one, the requirements will be recorded as user stories. These user stories
will be listed along with conditions of satisfaction for each one of them. The user stories will include features
recommended by users along with the purpose and functionality of the feature.

### Prioritisation method
To prioritise the user stories, a combination of two techniques will be used. First, the user stories will be split
using there MoSCoW method. This will split the user stories into four main categories. The categories are as follows:

- **Must have**: The feature must be included in the final product
- **Should have**: The feature is of great importance but not as crucial and time sensitive as the previous category
- **Could have**: The feature provides great additions to the product but will not be considered at the moment due to time and budget constraints
- **Won't have**: The feature provides little input ot the project and will be considered if there is time left to work on the project

Using MoSCoW, the features will be split into groups and the next phase of prioritisation will start. As the method used
is an agile methodology, regular scrum meetings need to take place. In these meetings, the team will decide to sort each
category further and add the user stories into a product backlog. This order can change throughout the development phase
and the user stories can be moved to new MoSCoW subgroup.

### Documented and prioritised requirements
The following is a list of prioritised user stories. Note that the order of importance can change during the development
process and that the following order was achieved after the first scrum meeting.
