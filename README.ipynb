    "## Project Methodology\n",
    "When designing a software, it is crucial to adhere to a certain methodology in order to get the best and most functional\n",
    "end result at the end of the project cycle. Methodologies help organize teams and finish tasks in a timely manner by\n",
    "providing them with a plan. (The Benefits of Adhering to a Software Development Methodology, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there exists a number of methodologies with manifestos which describe the processes required to currently\n",
    "implement them into a software or data science project. The majority of these methodologies however, lie into two\n",
    "categories, waterfall and agile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The waterfall model splits a project in to steps which need to be followed linearly. Each step of the process depends\n",
    "directly on the previous step. Thus, if a change in plan occurs and an earlier step needs to be repeated, all the\n",
    "following steps need to follow suit. (Petersen, Wohlin and Baca, 2009) Such a model is really time-consuming and by the\n",
    "time the project is complete, the user needs might have changed requiring further work on the project or potentially\n",
    "considering the project a failed one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile methodology is a different kind of approach characterized by a set of values which were included in *The\n",
    "Manifesto for Agile Software Development*. The distinguishing factor of agile methodologies is the fact that they take\n",
    "an iterative approach to software development. Tasks are split into increments and each increment undergoes a\n",
    "development phase at a different time from the other increments. This allows for more control over the project and its\n",
    "ability to satisfy continuously changing business needs. Agile approaches are usually called adaptive. This is due to\n",
    "their reliance on a rolling wave approach in which tasks and milestones are identified but the path to achieve them is\n",
    "flexible. This adaptive approach is the reason why the project can still continue normally even if these milestones\n",
    "change. (Larman, 2004)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria for selection of project methodology\n",
    "The following are a number of criteria which would play an important role in selecting the methodology used to create\n",
    "the final web app:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adaptability to change in business needs:** The requirements of the project owner can easily change over time,\n",
    "especially if since the project is in such an early stage and the business owner will have a clear insight into the\n",
    "capabilities and reach of the project as development commences.\n",
    "2. **Minimizing time requirements:** The method used must be the most efficient as the team working project have a tight\n",
    "deadline and must also focus on tasks from other modules in the university.\n",
    "3. **Data science implementation:** Not all methodologies are meant to be used for data science applications. Some\n",
    "are designed for software engineering while other are meant for data science. However, some methodologies are built on\n",
    "values which allows them to be used for both types of projects.\n",
    "4. **Ease of adopting the method:** As the team is made up of students with little to no knowledge of software\n",
    "engineering or data science, the selected method must be easy to learn for beginners.\n",
    "5. **Frequency of feedback:** It is desired to use a method with constant feedback about the functionality of the\n",
    "web app. This will ensure the web app is running as desired and any additional improvements can be suggested during the\n",
    "development phase.\n",
    "6. **Frequent communication with business owner:** It is important that there is constant contact with the business\n",
    "asking for the web app. This will insure the web app is made according to client's wishes and prevent conflict\n",
    "between the two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "(It is worth noting that the criteria above are not ranked in order of importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortlist of Methodologies\n",
    "Methodology | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "*CRISP-DM* | A model which splits the data science life cycle in 6 phases (CRISP-DM - Data Science Process Alliance, 2021) | <ul><li>Easily Implemented</li><li>Widely used for data science with extensive documentation</li></ul> | <ul><li>Many consider it to be a rigid waterfall</li><li>Requires documentation of each step which wastes time</li></ul>\n",
    "*Scrum* | An agile method in which the project is completed in increments called sprints. Each sprint takes the same amount of time as the other ones (Mihajlović Milićević et al., 2019) | <ul><li>Regular Feedback</li><li>Saves time</li></ul> | <ul><li>Needs experienced team members to implement</li><li>Project disruption can occur by unavailability of one team member</li></ul>\n",
    "*Kanban* | An agile method similar to scrum with the difference being that instead of having sprints, the team constantly pull work from a backlog after having vacancy for more work (Belov, 2020) | <ul><li>Efficient for data science</li><li>Continuous with with regular feedback</li></ul> | <ul><li>Lack of iterations when compared to scrum</li><li>Project is not split in phases or sprints like scrum. This means there are no timeframes which could result in inefficient workflows</li></ul>\n",
    "*TDSP* | A modern more agile data science methodology which helps improve efficiency of a working team. It is very similar to other models such as CRISP-DM (Team Data Science Process (TDSP), 2021) | <ul><li>Agile</li><li>Very modern and recommends use of new methods such as machine learning</li></ul> | <ul><li>Very new which means it is not widely implemented</li><li>Many inconsistencies in documentation</li></ul>\n",

    "### Selected Methodology\n",
    "Based on extensive research and analysis, it has been decided that the team will use a combination of CRISP-DM and\n",
    "Scrum. This section will explain the individual benefits of such methodologies and the benefits of combining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the team decided to use CRISP-DM is due to the fact that it follows steps in a logical order. The\n",
    "team deems these steps and their order appropriate for a data science project. Furthermore, the simplicity of the model\n",
    "helps grasp the method easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum helps organise teams by handing out smaller tasks with assigned deadlines. Regular scrum meetings ensure all the\n",
    "aspects of the problem is regularly discussed and any issues are brought into everyone's attention. Creating smaller\n",
    "pieces of the project allows feedback from the consumers and the product owner which could result in additional work in\n",
    "the backlog. Problems can be identified early on reducing their impact on the overall project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Scrum with CRISP-DM allows the team to use the work ethic and structure modelled by scrum while following\n",
    "CRISP-DM as guide for development. This results in converting CRISP-DM into an agile method which is crucial for data\n",
    "science projects.\n",

    "## Definition of the business need\n",
    "### Problem definition\n",
    "The time taken for a tennis match is not predefined or fixed as opposed to other sports like football. There are many\n",
    "factors which influence the length of match like the quality of the competing players. However, one factor which is\n",
    "often overlooked is the time between a point and the next serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different players take different intervals of time before serving. Furthermore, the type of ground the game is played is\n",
    "also hypothesised to affect the serve times in a game. This creates an uncertainty in the tennis match lengths.\n",
    "The governing tennis body is greatly affected by such uncertainties especially when it comes to broadcasting. Games\n",
    "taking longer than planned can cause audiences to abandon the match reducing ratings and revenue. Furthermore, conflicts\n",
    "in broadcasting schedules can occur due to longer match times.\n",
    "\n",
    "By getting a clearer understanding of tennis match serve times, the broadcasters and audiences can be informed of the\n",
    "expected match times beforehand. Furthermore, the window between a point and the next serve can be used as an\n",
    "opportunity to introduce overlay tv ads such as the one shown below. This means the governing tennis body has more room\n",
    "to display advertisements and thus, boost revenues.\n",
